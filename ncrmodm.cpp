/*
Given 3 integer N,R and M. You task is to calculate NCR%M.
Input:
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of 3 integers N,R and M.
Output:
For each test case output a single integer representing the value of NCR%M
Constraints :
1<=T<=100
1<=R<=N<=10^9
1<=M<=10^5 where  M is a square free and the largest prime factor of M is <=50.
 
Example:
Input:
3
4 2 28681
3 1 43710
5 3 3655
Output:
6
